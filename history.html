										<p>Android was founded in October 2003 by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White with the initial goal of developing an advanced operating system for digital cameras. However, as the smartphone market began to expand rapidly, the founders decided to shift their focus toward mobile devices. In 2005, Google acquired Android Inc. and appointed Andy Rubin to lead the development of what would become one of the world’s most popular mobile platforms. Google’s acquisition provided crucial resources and backing, enabling Android to compete with established players in the mobile operating system market.</p>
										<p>The first Android-powered device, the HTC Dream (also known as the T-Mobile G1), was launched in October 2008. The operating system was built on a Linux kernel and designed to be open-source, allowing manufacturers and developers to freely modify and improve it. This open approach attracted many hardware manufacturers such as Samsung, LG, and Motorola, who began adopting Android for their smartphones. The flexibility of Android, combined with its user-friendly interface and seamless integration with Google’s services, helped it gain massive popularity in a short time.</p>
										<p>An interesting aspect of Android’s history is its iconic logo—a green robot known as “Bugdroid.” The logo was designed by Irina Blok, a graphic designer at Google, in 2007. Blok and her team aimed to create a simple, friendly, and recognizable mascot that would symbolize the open-source nature and adaptability of Android. The design was inspired by common restroom symbols and quickly became one of the most recognizable tech logos in the world.</p>
										<p>Today, Android has grown far beyond smartphones, powering devices such as tablets, smartwatches, smart TVs, and even cars through platforms like Android Auto. Its vast app ecosystem, supported by millions of developers, has made it the world’s leading mobile operating system. Android’s continued evolution through regular updates, new features, and improved security ensures its dominance in the mobile technology landscape, serving billions of users globally.</p>
